Offline Payment Wallet for smaller amounts usually for change

App idea is basically when we dont have change money of say Rs. 1, 2, 3, 4 we either let it go or we pay the 5 rs.
Some time vendor leave it or give us a chocolate.

Our solution for this problem is picoin. Offline currency for these smaller transaction we usually ignore.

If you want to receive change you both will have app, sender will open his qr code, will select amount he want to send.
And you will scan it from your app.

If all transaction is good you will get those change money in your account. and it will be cut from his account.

All transactions are offline.

#TODO
As it was 2 day event we are not able to complete few points but those are in todo list for now.


Transaction Listing Display. (Transaction are save in database only display is pending).
Auto Acknoledgement using quiteshare library (data over sound) so sender account will be deducted right now we are doing it manually.
